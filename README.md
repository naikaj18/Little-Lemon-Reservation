# Project Description -
This project was developed as part of Meta’s Coursera Front-End Development course, serving as the capstone for the Front-End Development Track.

The website features a booking application for the Little Lemon platform, built with React components to demonstrate a strong grasp of React in web development, including the use of API calls. While the site design is fully implemented, the primary interactive feature currently available is the “Reserve a Table” function, showcasing the core functionality of the booking system.
